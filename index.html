					<h3>Difference Between UX and UI</h3>
					<p>
						UX stands for User Experience. This is how the user or person is <b>enjoying</b> your content/product. This usually is how the user is taking in the UI of your product and how they appeal to it. A good UX means a good UI!
					</p>
					<p>
						UI stands for User Interface. This is how your product <b>looks</b> like visually to the user. Usually, you would want your product to be <i>appealing</i> to the user so the UI would have to look neat and clean.

					<h3>What I thought of CSS</h3>
					<p>
						I think CSS is a cool way of organizing your work and to make your coding look more clean. You can have a seperate tab of all of the background color, font size, font color, etc seperated from the main structure of your code.
